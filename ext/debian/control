Description: Dynamically create package resources from lists
 Dynamcially creates a package resource for each element in a list, and ensures
 that each version is enforced. Any package not defined in your package list
 will automatically generate a package resource with an ensure => absent, giving
 you the power to define exactly what you want on your system in one list and
 enforce it using Puppet. For each package in a package list, an ensure will be
 dynamically created to "latest". This allows you to either place an exact
 package version in (along with the name), or simply the package name if you
 want the latest from your mirror.
